1. Code to copy text files from data folder into working directory and keep the same file names.
```{r}
setwd("U:/My Documents/_research/R-working/gsea")
text_files <- list.files(path = "U:/My Documents/_research/R-working/gsea/gsea-data", 
              pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)
target_folder <- getwd()
file.copy(text_files, target_folder)
```
